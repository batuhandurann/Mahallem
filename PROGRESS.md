# Progress — Burada / Mahallem

Updated: 2026-10-08 (Europe/Istanbul). Read `AGENTS.md` and git status before work;
fetch current remote state because other sessions may advance the repository.

## Completed and verified

- PR #10 merged into `main`, merge commit `ae70278c4424fb45a1fad4b3bc5e7a90bbca7cce`.
- Both main workflows passed: Android Quality run `37777012961`, Security run
  `37777012995`. Actual debug APK, clean unsigned release APK/AAB, unit tests,
  lint, 12 Android instrumentation tests and lifecycle smoke passed. Auth/Rules
  23 tests, private photo/moderation 2 tests and backend 4 tests passed.
- CodeQL Java/Kotlin + JavaScript and secret scan passed. Main protection has
  eight required checks and no bypass actors. Required aliases depend on the
  actual build/emulator/backend jobs, so they cannot pass on skipped failures.
- Firestore/UID integration, account isolation, public published discovery,
  private chat/photo/report/block flows, Burada package identity and five-area
  neighborhood pilot are in main. This is not nationwide geography or payments.
- Production follow-up: signed APK/AAB signature validation, configurable upload
  alias, main-only protected signing, temporary-secret cleanup; authorized live
  Firebase audit/deploy; USB physical Auth/Rules/lifecycle runner. The combined
  Python suite passed 31 tests, including real fixture JAR signing checks.
  Fixtures do not prove production signing or live Firebase configuration.
- Physical-device preflight observed zero attached phones and returned `NOT_RUN`.
  Local Firebase preflight rejected the old Android registration before Cloud
  access. No credentials or deployment were invented.

## Still blocked on real access

- Register/download `com.batuhanduran.burada` Firebase Android configuration.
- Protected production upload keystore/passwords and Firebase configuration for
  the signed build; Cloud WIF/deploy principal and production variables for audit
  and deployment. No such credentials are available in this execution environment.
- Real phone/authorized Test Lab access. Verify signed Play internal-testing
  attestation, Console enforcement/API restrictions and genuine FCM delivery,
  including blocked users and account switching. Prepared workflows are not
  successful production executions.
- Full write-path abuse controls, production load/monitoring, nationwide data,
  voice and payments remain outside the completed feature integrations.

## Next concrete task

Review this production follow-up's GitHub checks and merge through normal main
protection. Then supply the protected inputs described in
`PRODUCTION_EXECUTION.md` / `FIREBASE_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY.md`, run the signed build,
phone tests and authorized live audit/deployment, and record their real result
IDs here. Do not repeat existing successful integration work.
